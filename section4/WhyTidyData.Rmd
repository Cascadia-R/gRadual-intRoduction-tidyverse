```

## What is Tidy Data?



## Not Tidy Data



## Making data tidy: `gather()`


```{r cars}
```

## `separate()`

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
