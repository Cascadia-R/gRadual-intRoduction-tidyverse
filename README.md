### What You'll Learn Today

Part 1 - Aesthetics and `ggplot2` - [Part1-ggplot2_intro.Rmd](Part1-ggplot2_intro.Rmd)

Part 2 - Factors and `ggplot2` - [Part2-workingWithFactors.Rmd](Part2-workingWithFactors.Rmd)

Part 3 - Manipulating Data using `dplyr` [Part3-dplyr_intro.Rmd]([Part3-dplyr_intro.Rmd)

Part 4 - The Whys and Hows of Tidy Data using `tidyr` [Part4-WhyTidyData.Rmd](Part4-WhyTidyData.Rmd)

### Before We Get Started

Before the workshop, please make sure that R and RStudio are installed on your laptop. (You should have version 3.3 or higher for R and version 1.0 or higher of RStudio.)  Then install the `tidyverse`, `gapminder`, `fivethirtyeight` and `rmarkdown` packages from CRAN using the following command:

```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "fivethirtyeight", "rmarkdown"))
```

### During the Workshop

We'll be using the cascadiarconf slack (http://cascadiarconf.slack.com) Go to the #gradual-tidyverse channel. Feel free to ask questions there! Please answer them if you know the answer.

Since there are so many of us, please get to know your neighbor and work together. If you have major issues, we'll try to get to you.

Use your Post-Its to signal whether your are doing ok (Green) or you need help (Red) and one of us will help you.
